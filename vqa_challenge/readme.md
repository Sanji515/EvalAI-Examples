# VQA Challenge
A challenge host team can create a chalenge using the **zip file** and once the challenge is approved by admin, then it can be hosted on EvalAI.
This folder contains the **vqa challenge zip file** as an example and its extracted contents.
For creating a challenge, a challenge host team should upload only the zip file.
